# Catalyst

Catalyst is a tool designed to help those working through depression and anxiety gain insight into and reframe their maladaptive thought patterns. It functions much like a mood tracker, however, it focuses on thought patterns rather than mood.

Users write a short description of what's on their mind, select one or many of the cognitive distortions – derived from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) – they're falling into, and then write how the situation would look if that distortion weren't present. If the user is unsure of how to reframe their thought, they can tap "Help" for a quick prompt on how they might reframe.

In addition to logging maladaptive thoughts, users can view their past entries as well as a chart that shows which cognitive distortions they fall into most often.

Users also have the option to restore their entries from iCloud in case they get a new device.

Finally, the app is secured via Face ID or a passcode depending on the device.
